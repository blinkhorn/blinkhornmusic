        <h2>BIO</h2>
        <div class="container">
          <p>
            Patrick Blinkhorn is a musician, producer, and software engineer
            from Washington, DC who records and performs music as Blinkhorn.
            Interested in music from a young age, one of Patrick's earliest
            memories are of his older sister's piano lessons and the joy he
            found in playing the keys himself after her lessons. Patrick's
            musical curiosity led to music lessons, compositions, and eventually
            studying music in college.
          </p>
          <p>
            After college, Patrick returned to DC and became involved in the
            local dance music community, DJing at a number of venues across the
            city. After he released a pair of techno tracks with French record
            label Emkan Records in 2017, Patrick started collaborating with

          </p>
          <p>
            In 2020, Patrick and his wife moved to the DC suburb Silver Spring,
            Maryland. Inspired by the natural beauty of Sligo Creek near their
            home, Patrick recorded sounds on Sligo Creek Trail, played Moog
            synthesizers over the recordings in his home studio, and released
            the music as his first album, <em>Sligo</em>, with Not Yet
            Remembered Records in November 2020.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Music for Rainy Days</em> is Patrick's second album and in many
            ways it can be considered the sequel to <em>Sligo</em>. Patrick's
            third album is <em>Joy Mechanics</em>, which was released with Not
            Yet Remembered Records on May 12, 2023.
          </p>
